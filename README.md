# Project Title: To approve or not to approve: Credit Cards?


# Project Description

The amount of credit card applications a bank has to handle every day is enormous. Not all applications are approved, however, with hypothesised reasons like high-loan balances, low-income levels, or poor credit track records. There are also those applications that were approved, but some borrowers have gone into credit default or displayed undesirable credit behaviour, and to the banks, that’s a loss on the books. Default risk is a very real problem for banks and financial institutions.

We think that it is important to understand what attributes are important and indicative of a borrower’s undesirable credit behaviour. We believe the lessons learnt may help to better inform decisions made by banks in approving credit card applications, controlling credit risk. On the consumer side, we may also get a better understanding of our application outcome since banks are unlikely to reveal rejection reasons directly.

This project aims classify an applicant as a potential good or bad borrower based on their personal information.
